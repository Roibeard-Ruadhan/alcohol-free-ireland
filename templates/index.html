                <h2>Becoming More Widespread</h2>
                    <p>It can still very much be a touchy subject when people first hear of somebody abstaining from alcohol. It has always played
                       a huge role in many cultures across the world, specifically on social occasions. As per the video below, non alcoholic drinks 
                       are becoming more accepeted & even more appealing every day. Walking into supermarkets now you can't help but realise, almost 
                       every week a new drink is added. Every month a new shelf is added to the non-alcohol drinks section. It is gradually taking over 
                       the whole supermarket one day at a time.</p>
